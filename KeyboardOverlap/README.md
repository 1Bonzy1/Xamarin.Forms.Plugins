# Setup
* Available on NuGet: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xam.Plugins.Forms.KeyboardOverlap/
* Add to your iOS project.

In your iOS project call:

```
Xamarin.Forms.Init();//platform specific init
KeyboardOverlapRenderer.Init ();
```

You must do this AFTER you call Xamarin.Forms.Init(). 

# Usage

No need for you to do anything other then initialize the plugin. The keyboard will no longer overlap your Controls!!!

For a detailed example clone the repo and take a look at the Sample App.
